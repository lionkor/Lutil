## Lutil

[This readme is a placeholder]

# Idea behind Lutil

I had gotten sick of having to write my own I/O snippets for saving some simple key-value pairs to disk, so I write the Ini library. It did very primitive .ini file I/O and I just kept expanding the library, which I then called Lutil (short for Lion's Utilities), adding more little things I needed from time to time.

# Features

A complete list of features is still in progress.

# But there is already a library for .ini handling, vectors, and everything else!

If you need any of these functionalities for an open source nonprofit project, just copy those parts of my code, don't bother with compiling the whole thing. 
I realize that most of these features are already available in a more secure, fast and neat way somewhere probably, but I want my own implementations for several different reasons, including easy expansion and not having to rely on 10 different libraries for little hobby projects. 
If you need a Vector library, there are a bunch out there that are probably faster and better, so use them instead. I enjoy using my Vector class implementation because it has so many handy quality-of-life overloads and detailed documentation inside. This makes it more bloated but saves me the time of having to write overloads for a foreign vector library.

## TL;DR

Lutil is some lazy programmer's code snippet collection. Use with care.
